Starting from a published design is a quick way to get started with a popular stack or solution.

## Exploring the Design Catalog

For your convenience, the design catalog can be accessed from three locations:

1. From the *Catalog* tab in _Kanvas Designer_.

2. From the _Layer5 Cloud_ catalog page at [Layer5 Cloud Catalog](https://meshery.layer5.io/catalog).

## Cloning a Design

To start from a design, select and create a [clone of the design](/kanvas/tasks/designs/cloning-a-design). If you are on the Kanvas design page, click on the chosen design from the **Catalog** tab. This will present a popup to clone the design, click **Clone** to begin.

This will create a copy of the catalog item to a new design, now owned by you.

You are now free to deploy it as it is or modify it further.
