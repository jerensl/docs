# Overview

![Shapes Introduction](./overview.png)

The whiteboarding feature introduces versatile, freestyle drawing capabilities within Kanvas. Enabling the whiteboard feature augments your ability to diagram with a suite of predefined shapes, and pen and pencil annotation, allowing you full freedom of expression of your engineering diagrams.

## Key Functionality

1. **Drawing Tools Integration**
   - Incorporates a comprehensive set of drawing tools resembling popular whiteboard applications.
   - Enables you to draw shapes, group components , annotate, and highlight specific elements within the infrastructure design canvas.
2. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - Facilitates simultaneous collaboration among multiple users within the tool.
   - Supports live editing and instant visualization of changes made by collaborators.
3. **Non-Invasive Annotations**
   - Annotations, shapes, or drawings created within the tool remain separate visual aids, not altering the actual infrastructure components.

Text annotations come with various options. Customize fonts, sizes, alignments, and styles easily. Text boxes resize for seamless integration with the canvas.

#### Interactive Tooltip Interface

![Tooltip](./tooltip.png)

The tooltip is your gateway to customization. It's simple and intuitive, offering a range of editing options upon selection. It's designed for easy navigation, mirroring popular design software.

#### Advanced Customization Features

Manage layers, group elements, for better organization. These advanced tools ensure collaborative work while preserving design integrity.

#### Line and Edge Editing

Lines and edges are easily manipulated. Adjust thickness, style, and endpoints effortlessly. Drag line segments to create bends or curves, adding detail to visual representations.

Tip:To enable this animation for an edge, set the animation property of relationship metadata to "marching-ants".
#### Consistent Functionality

The customization tools apply uniformly to all annotation types. Changes made within the tooltip reflect instantly on the canvas, facilitating real-time collaboration.

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Communication**
   - Facilitates clearer communication by allowing visual annotations on specific design components.
   - Reduces ambiguity and ensures better understanding of design intentions.

2. **Efficient Collaborative Workflows**
   - Real-time collaboration accelerates feedback loops, enhancing team productivity.
   - Enables instant sharing of ideas and design iterations among team members.

3. **Safe Environment for Creativity**
   - Offers a risk-free environment for drawing, experimenting, and ideation without impacting the actual infrastructure.
   - Encourages creativity and exploration within the design canvas.

### Use Cases

- **Team Collaboration:** Multiple users collaborating on infrastructure designs, adding annotations and insights simultaneously.
- **Educational Context:** Instructors and students using the tool for visualizing concepts or workflows in remote learning environments.
- **Architecture and Healthcare Planning:** Professionals in architecture or healthcare visualizing and annotating designs collaboratively.

### Conclusion

The whiteboarding and freestyle drawing feature enriches Kanvas's visual infrastructure designer tool by seamlessly integrating drawing capabilities without compromising the integrity of the underlying infrastructure. Its versatility in enabling real-time collaboration, preserving data integrity, and fostering a safe creative space positions it as a powerful asset for effective communication, efficient collaboration, and innovative ideation within diverse professional settings.
